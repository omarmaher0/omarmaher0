💡 Discovered a passion for **data engineering** during my graduation project after encountering challenges with incomplete datasets. That experience sparked my mission: **to support data teams by building reliable and well-structured data pipelines**.

🎓 As a CS student, I'm diving deep into the world of big data, cloud computing, and real-time processing.

🔧 My work focuses on:
- Designing & building **ETL/ELT pipelines**
- Working with **streaming data** using Kafka
- Leveraging **cloud tools** like AWS (Glue, Lambda, Athena, S3)
- Managing large-scale data using **Apache Spark** and **Airflow**

🧠 I also have strong soft skills like problem-solving, time management, and effective communication.

💬 Ask me about:
- PySpark, SQL, Airflow, Kafka, MongoDB, AWS
- Building real-time and batch processing systems

💪 Fun Fact: When I’m not building data pipelines, I’m training at the gym or enjoying healthy food.
